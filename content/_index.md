      title: 'üìö My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am an atmospheric scientist with expertise in remote sensing, climate modeling, and hydrological hazards. My research focuses on understanding atmospheric moisture dynamics, particularly elevated moist layers, and their representation in satellite observations and climate models.

        Currently, I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University and NOAA-GFDL, where I investigate the relationship between extreme precipitation and river flood changes under warming conditions. I'm also contributing to high-resolution land surface model inter-comparison projects and implementing orographic disaggregation schemes for precipitation.

        My work bridges fundamental atmospheric science with applied climate research, helping us better understand and predict hydrological hazards in a changing climate.

        Please reach out to collaborate on atmospheric science, climate modeling, or remote sensing projects! üå¶Ô∏è
