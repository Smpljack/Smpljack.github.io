        I am an atmospheric scientist with expertise in the hydrological cycle and a particular interest in hydrological hazards, utilizing remote sensing and climate modeling. My doctoral research elucidated our ability to resolve vertical moisture structures in the atmosphere with [satellite observations  and reanalysis data](/publications/elevated-moist-layers-reanalysis/), and how the moisture structure couples to the [dynamics of precipitating convection](/publications/seasonal-emergence-moist-layers/). Besides analysing large and sparse datasets, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity of actively participating in the [EUREC4A field campaign](/publications/eurec4a-dataset/) on Barbados in 2020.

        My ongoing postdoctoral research revolves around hydrological extremes on the land surface. In my [recent pre-print](/publications/precipitation-streamflow-thermodynamics/) I used the GFDL climate model to shed light on the  relationship between extreme precipitation and river flood changes under a warming climate. I also implemented an orographic disaggregation scheme into the GFDL land model for downscaling precipitation and other meteorological fields to an advanced, machine-learning based sub-grid scheme, called [HydroBlocks](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/22/3311/2018/). Currently, I am preparing simulations for a kilometer-scale land surface model inter-comparison project to examine the models' readiness for recent paradigm changing pushes to high resolution climate modeling.

        Please reach out to collaborate on atmospheric science, hydrological hazards, or remote sensing projects! üå¶Ô∏è üõ∞ Ô∏è
