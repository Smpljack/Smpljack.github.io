I am an atmospheric scientist with a PhD in Earth System Science from the University of Hamburg. I conducted my Bachelor, Master and PhD degrees in a research group on radiation and remote sensing, giving me a rich experience in Earth observation methods and data products. Recently, I turned to a more applied perspective of studying hydrological hazards using climate models through a postdoc at Princeton University hosted at Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), where I explored the relationship of extreme precipitation and river flood changes with warming.
